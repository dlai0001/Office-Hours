NOTES:

Starting the Server
===================
1) Create an account or login to your google account in appspot.com
2) Create an app.  Give it a unique name.
3) On your local machine, edit the app.yaml file.  Then edit the application name to match.
4) Download / install app engine launcher.
5) Add your application to the app engine launcher. (part of app engine sdk, https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads)
6) Deploy the application or you can launch it locally with AppEngine launcher.

Additional Notes:
I've stripped out my account information that was previously hard coded during the hackathon.  You
may have to edit some files to configure with your accounts, most notably is the notifications.py.


Simple Chat
===========
David - I've put together a quick and dirty simple chat,
http://localhost:8080/app/index.html#chats/mychannel/SenderName
It uses EmberJS, bootstrap, and jQuery.
